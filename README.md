Reach RSVP centralized DApp tutorial.

Two new concepts are introduced in this tutorial.

First, APIs. These are sources of publications that do not come from a participant. These are a source of input events to the consensus network.

Second, mappings. These are databases of values which will grow over the timeline of use of the application, growing linearly over time.

Structure of centralized DApp:
1. Host participant creates an application instance.
2. Guest participant class instances attach to the application and make reservations.
3. Host performs API calls to report if the guest participants come to the event.
4. The program ends after all guest participants have been reported as having attended or not.
